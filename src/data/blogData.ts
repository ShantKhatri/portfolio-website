# Blending AI with Automation Testing: How I Accidentally Hacked My Way Into Smart QA

## üß† "Why is this test flaky again?"
That one sentence haunted me early in my automation journey. You fix one bug, run the tests‚Ä¶ and boom‚Äîsome random test fails again for no good reason. You rerun it, and it passes. Classic.

That's when I started asking questions nobody around me was really asking:

- What if our test systems could think a little?
- Could a machine learning model flag flaky tests before they waste my time?
- Why are we still hardcoding test data when we could just generate it smartly?

Hi, I'm Prashantkumar Khatri, and over the past few years, I've been dancing between machine learning, test automation, and full-stack development‚Äîsometimes gracefully, sometimes clumsily. But through it all, I've learned one thing:

**Smart systems can (and should) test themselves.**

## üõ†Ô∏è The Reality of Traditional Test Automation
Let me be real‚Äîtest automation is amazing. It saves time, improves coverage, and helps you sleep better at night.

But...

- You end up writing the same types of test scripts over and over
- Tests break not because of bugs‚Äîbut because the DOM sneezed
- And you spend more time debugging test failures than actual features

It felt like I was spending my energy maintaining something dumb, when the rest of my stack was getting smarter.

I didn't want a dumb test framework anymore.
I wanted an intelligent test buddy that could grow with my code.

## üîç So, I Brought AI Into the Picture
I started exploring how machine learning could sit quietly inside the QA pipeline and just watch. Learn. React.

Here's where AI turned out to be surprisingly useful:

| Problem | AI-Powered Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Tests failing randomly | Model identifies flaky tests based on patterns |
| Boring UI comparisons | Use computer vision instead of pixel-by-pixel diffs |
| Long execution times | Predict which tests are most important right now |
| Log hell | NLP to auto-summarize logs and find root causes |

It wasn't magic. Just curiosity, some data, and small tweaks. And honestly? It made automation fun again.

## üí° Stuff I Actually Built
Working with projects like Eclipse 4diac (GSoC), Shikshalokam (DMP), and my own apps like PrintSEC and DigitalWiseon, I started plugging intelligence into my tools:

- Made a smart test listener that logs failures and emails clean reports
- Used OCR + NLP to detect sensitive info inside documents
- Built a framework that tests both web and native apps using the same codebase
- Started experimenting with AI-generated test data and user flows

Some of it worked, some of it didn't. But every experiment taught me more about how to build test systems that feel less like robots and more like colleagues.

## ‚ú® So... What's Next?
We're not far from a world where:

- Test scripts are generated from how users actually interact with your app
- Logs explain themselves
- Your pipeline tells you where the problem is
- QA becomes less about writing scripts and more about training smart systems to understand context

That's the future I'm chasing. And I think we all should.

## üí¨ Final Words From One Engineer to Another
If you're an automation engineer, a tester, or just someone who's tired of fragile pipelines‚Äîgive AI a seat at the table. You don't need to be a machine learning wizard. Start small. Play with visual diffing. Try log summarization. Automate your automation.

The tools are here. The problems are waiting. And the results? Pretty awesome.

Let's make testing smarter‚Äîand fun again.

## üì£ Over to You
What's the most annoying part of your test pipeline right now?
Ever tried mixing ML with automation?

Drop me a message or connect‚Äîwe might just build the next intelligent framework together. üôÇ

# How Freelancing Paid My Bills, but Open Source Fed My Soul

Back in college, like many of us, I needed cash.
And let's be honest‚Äîinternships don't always pay, and coding contests don't refill UPI wallets.

So, I turned to freelancing.
No big startup dreams, no "changing the world" mindset‚Äîjust a student armed with React Native and the will to build fast, break less, and get five-star reviews.

## üíº The Freelance Chapter: Real Clients, Real Deadlines, Real Growth
Freelancing taught me:

- How to write production-grade code
- How to explain complex bugs to non-tech clients at 2 AM
- And how to survive on chai and 4 hours of sleep

It was fun, messy, and honestly, addictive. I shipped apps, solved bugs I didn't create (the real challenge), and learned to write code that worked on the first run (sometimes).

But something was missing.

I wasn't building with people, I was building for people.
And while that paid the bills, it didn't exactly spark joy.

## üß© Enter: Open Source
I stumbled into open source like you trip over a step in the dark.
No grand plan. Just me, lurking on GitHub at 1 AM, reading issues I barely understood.

At first, I thought:

"These people are too smart for me."
"They'll laugh at my pull request."
"Why would anyone want a fix from someone who still googles 'how to exit Vim'?"

But I took the leap.

One comment.
One fix.
One tiny contribution.

Suddenly, I was part of something bigger than a Trello board of tasks.

## üéì GSoC: The Summer That Changed Everything
Then came Google Summer of Code 2024.

No, it wasn't easy.
Yes, I almost gave up writing that proposal.

But I got in.

Working with the Eclipse Foundation on automating graphical editors in the 4diac IDE? That was wild. I was:

- Writing automation scripts that actually helped users
- Getting code reviewed by engineers I used to follow
- And realizing how beautifully collaborative this world is

It wasn't just a project.
It was ownership, mentorship, and belonging.

## üîÅ From Client Feedback to Community Feedback
What changed?

Freelance taught me to solve someone's problem.
Open source taught me to solve a shared problem.

It's a shift from:

- Delivering features to building ecosystems
- Working in silos to growing in public
- Charging per project to contributing for purpose

## üöÄ Why You Should Try Open Source Too
Look‚Äîopen source is not just for "10x devs" or Linux kernel wizards.
It's for anyone who's ever:

- Fixed a bug and wanted to share the fix
- Wondered "how was this tool built?"
- Wanted to build a portfolio that speaks for itself

If you're still hesitating, I get it.
But trust me, your first PR‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîwill hit different.

You'll be part of something that's powering industries, tools, classrooms, and codebases around the world.

## üí¨ Final Thoughts (and an Ask)
If you're a student, a freelancer, a self-taught dev‚Äîtry open source.

Not for the resume. Not for the likes.
But for the people you'll meet.
The things you'll learn.
The impact you'll create.

And hey‚Äîif you ever want help getting started, shoot me a message.
I'll help you find that first issue, write that PR, or just talk through the imposter syndrome.

We're all learning. Together.
